# A Toolkit for Climate and Meteorological Data Retrieving

This repository holds a Jupyter notebook intended as a practical tool for fetching and preprocessing data related to climate and weather conditions, useful in climate science studies. The notebook has a download module that uses API calls to pull data from primary sources, requiring users to input their preferences in a dictionary-style parameter set. 

The notebook also details a method for saving the collected data to a disk, highlighting a format suitable for the next stages of analysis. The notebook includes also a set of features for basic data manipulation. Users are instructed on exploiting data by choosing particular time frames and spatial regions and resampling data in new temporal timeframes.

## Usage

To use the notebook, please register at CDS portal https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home and obtain an authorization key.

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and follow the instructions within the notebook.
