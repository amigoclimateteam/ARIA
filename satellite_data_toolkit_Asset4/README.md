# Geospatial Data Downloading and Processing Toolkit

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook designed as a toolkit for processing geospatial data, featuring an array of functions and workflows crucial for managing and analyzing information related to geospatial and terrain features.

The notebook outlines a coherent sequence of data processing techniques specifically suited for geospatial data. Users are required to register with the EU Dataspace programme to download satellite data from the OpenEO repository. They have the option to choose from a variety of collections that include not only Digital Elevation Model data but also raw data from the Sentinel 1-2-3 satellites. Furthermore, the notebook demonstrates how to preprocess this data using fundamental functionalities. This includes calculating the slope and aspect from a Digital Elevation Model, which are vital steps for applying ML models.

## Usage

To use the notebook it is necessary to register at https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/.
